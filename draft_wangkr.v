(** In this task, you should first prove a general theorem which can be used to
    prove an equivalence between two recursively defined semantics, and another
    general theorem which can be used to prove an equivalence between a
    recursively defined program semantics and a small step semantics.

    Then, you need to prove the equivalence among three denotational program
    semantics and a small step semantics. *)
